# Web_Scraping-For_EDA
Web Scraping for Exploratory data analysis
In this exercise we perform the extraction of the data from the web which is known as web scraping.
We scrap the IMDB data for Top 50 movies using urlib request and beautiful soup.
Then we perform the major 4 steps of the web sraping so that the data can be used for further analysis.
Those 4 steps are:
Reading: For HTML page read and upload
Parsing: For beautifying the HTML code in an understandable format
Extraction: For extraction of data from the web page
Transformation: For converting the information into the required format, e.g., CSV

Now the data converted/ extracted can be further used for any type of analysis.

Thank you !!!!
